# retracker-python

A very primitive retracker for local network.
A retracker allows 2 or more computers in one local network communicate via torrent protocol with high speed.

It's don't works with utorrent.
It works with transmission on windows/linux (on windows check firewall to allow local connections for torrent client)

You need bencode package.
Get it there: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/BitTorrent-bencode/5.0.8#downloads
Unpack it into retracker-python/bencode, so bencode.py should be at path retracker-python/bencode/bencode.py
